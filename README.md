Ph.D.-trained Data Scientist with 8+ years of experience in quantitative analysis, statistical modeling, and applied data science. I specialize in building reproducible analytical workflows and production-grade data applications that support data-driven decision-making.

My work combines advanced statistical and Bayesian modeling, machine learning, and software engineering practices, with hands-on experience in R, Python, SQL, CI/CD, and containerized deployments. I focus on translating complex data into actionable insights through robust analysis, interactive dashboards, and clear analytical narratives.

Currently, I work as a Data Scientist at CEPTRO / NIC.br, where I develop and maintain analytical systems used to understand and monitor internet usage and network quality in Brazil. I collaborate in international and interdisciplinary teams and bring strong experience working across cultural and institutional contexts.

## 🔍 What I Work On

- **Applied Data Science & Analytics**: Designing and delivering data-driven solutions using R, Python, and SQL, with a strong focus on statistical modeling, exploratory analysis, and decision support on complex, real-world datasets.

- **Production-Grade Analytical Systems**: Building and maintaining reproducible analytical workflows, Shiny applications, and data pipelines, including CI/CD, testing, containerization, and deployment to production environments.

- **End-to-End Project Ownership**: Taking analytical projects from data integration and modeling to visualization, communication, and long-term maintainability, bridging research-grade methods and operational systems.

- **International & Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Working in international and cross-functional teams across Europe and Brazil, contributing in English, Portuguese, and German, and translating complex analyses for diverse technical and non-technical stakeholders.
